	<h2>How We Began</h2>
				<p class="history">The idea of a family reunion was born during the gatering of family memebers at the funeral of Daisy Partee on August 10, 1983, in Chicago, Illinois. While in Chicago, Eddie Brown, suggested that the family come to his home in Memphis, Tennessee, for Labor Day weekend for a "get together." He felt that funerals should not be the only time extended family members see each other. Approximately 20 families gathered in Memphis on that weekend in 1983.<br> 
				The second reunion took place in Memphis again during Labor Day weekend in 1984. For the next nine years, the Browns gathered each Labor Day weekend to celebrate family. During that time we gathered in various cities in Illinois, Mississippi, Tennessee and Georgia. It was always tradition to have a Friday night Meet and Greet, a cookout on Saturday and family worship service.<br>
				We owe it to our elders, those here and those who have gone on, to keep their legacy alive. We owe it to this new generation of children to give them the same fond childhood memories that we have. We must make sure the legacy never ends!</p>
